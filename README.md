### A little about me

I love Linux, I like Fedora, I periodically try other distributions.

I write application programs in Python and bash that are useful to me for the convenience of living in Linux (or a cross-platform environment).

Among them are:

- quick search notes system
- event handling system from additional keyboard and mouse buttons
- window management script in Gnome 3/4
- service for tracking news and events on the Internet
- and other projects


Skills: Python, Bash, QT, HTML, CSS.

I often use Inkscape.
